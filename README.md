# Student Grade, Speed Detector, and Net Salary Calculator

This repository contains three simple but powerful programs to demonstrate various programming concepts.

## **Student Grade Generator**
This program takes the marks a student has scored and tells what grade they get. It’s a straightforward way to see how conditional logic can be used to categorize data.

## **Speed Detector**
This program checks the speed of a car and decides if it’s too fast, giving points if it is, and can determine if a driver should lose their license for speeding too much. It illustrates how to implement control flow based on numerical input.

## **Net Salary Calculator**
This program calculates a person’s take-home pay after deducting taxes and other contributions from their salary and benefits. It’s useful for understanding how to perform arithmetic operations and deductions in programming.
